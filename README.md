## Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 
Our goal in this analysis is to answer why 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments. who receive treatment instructions do not show up at the next appointment time. In other words, what are the contributing factors for missing appointments?

Some questions we can ask to help us explore the data:

* What is the ratio of people who miss appointments to those who don’t?
* Does the patient gender has a realation with the atendance?
* What is the most popular month/day/hour for not showing up?
* What is the age distribution of patients?
* Does the neighborhood play a role in making patients don't show up? "Location of the hospital"
* Which patients show up more? Does old age take better care of their health more than youth?
* Does the disease type affect the patient's show up?
